Please put all your ideas here so we can all know what we're 
MAINLY working on, and then compile a todolist.

---General stuff:
    - Jokers
    - Inventory (eventually, not exactly important)   
---Jabon Gratis (feel free to help as much as you want on these,
my code fucking sucks):
 - Fishing
 - Half Jokers
 - some spritework
